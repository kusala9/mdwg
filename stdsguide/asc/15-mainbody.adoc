== Intro and Summary
== This Document
== Background
=== UNCLOS
* Short history of the relevant parts of UNCLOS, the parts relevant to this project
* Wider applicability, e.g. MSP and other marine uses. How OGC can fit into that, MSDI as the broad term for these uses of data

=== IHO / S-121 history
* Description of the S-100
* S-100 for the unitiated, how PS development works, registry, feature catalogue etc.
* S-121 for the unitiated, brief description of model
* Where is S-121 now?
* User Perspective?


== OGC Pilot Project
=== Pilot Project objectives and Goals
* Description of goals and objectives for the project.
* How it is achieved

=== Structure of project

== Deliverables
=== GML Application schema
==== Background to GML AS for S-121
* Description of IHO S-100 GML schema development
* Use, how S-100 is structured and the constraints
* Unique challenges with S-121
* Approach taken in project
* Current client implementations, also where S-100 adoption is
* What the S-100 profile provides
* S-100 for the uninitiated
* S-121 for the unitiated (model description)

==== Structure of schema

* modular structure
* features, information types, geometry
* how features are aggregated into collections
* how topology and geometry is dealt with
* Use cases

==== Example uses


=== Client SDI
==== Current state
